window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Dating to the ninth century BC, Homer’s timeless poem still vividly conveys the horror and heroism of men and gods wrestling with towering emotions and battling amidst devastation and destruction, as it moves inexorably to the wrenching, tragic conclusion of the Trojan War.&nbsp;</p> <p>Renowned classicist Bernard Knox observes in his superb Introduction that although the violence of the <i>Iliad </i>is grim and relentless, it coexists with both images of civilized life and a poignant yearning for peace.&nbsp;</p> <p>Combining the skills of a poet and scholar, Robert Fagles brings the energy of contemporary language to this enduring heroic epic. He maintains the drive and metric music of Homer’s poetry and evokes the impact and nuance of the <i>Iliad’</i>s mesmerizing repeated phrases in what Peter Levi calls “an astonishing performance”.</p>";
