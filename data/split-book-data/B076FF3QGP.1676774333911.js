However, in keeping with true gothic tradition, Dr Jekyll must now face a race against time as damning evidence is uncovered, and the investigating detectives and interested parties are brought right to his door. </p> <p>Hailed by the Detective Club as 'one of the most amazing crime stories ever written', Stevenson's <i>Jekyll and Hyde</i> was met with immediate critical approval, ensuring its success and popularity for years to come. </p> <p>A highly accomplished Scottish novelist, poet and travel writer, Robert Louis Stevenson is also credited with stories of <i>Treasure Island</i>, <i>A Child's Garden of Verses</i> and <i>Kidnapped</i>.

In 2014, he was merited with having narrated the Audiobook of the Year, <i>Hamlet, Prince of Denmark: A Novel</i>. </p> <p>Providing another equally captivating performance in this new and highly anticipated adaptation of <i>The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde</i>, Richard Armitage gradually builds and maintains the perfect atmosphere needed for this suspenseful classic horror story. </p>";
