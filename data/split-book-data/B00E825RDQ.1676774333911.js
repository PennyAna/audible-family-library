window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>When Marilla and Matthew Cuthbert of Green Gables, Prince Edward Island, send for a boy orphan to help them out at the farm, they are in no way prepared for the error that will change their lives. The mistake takes the shape of Anne Shirley, a redheaded 11-year-old girl who can talk anyone under the table. Fortunately, her sunny nature and quirky imagination quickly win over her reluctant foster parents. Anne's feisty spirit soon draws many friends - and much trouble - her way. </p> <p>Montgomery wrote the novel in the twilight of the day, sitting at her window and overlooking the fields of Cavendish. Since publication, <i>Anne of Green Gables</i> has sold more than 50 million copies.</p>";
