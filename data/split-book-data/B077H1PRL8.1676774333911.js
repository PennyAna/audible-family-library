If so, Rachel Hollis has something to tell you: that’s a lie.</p> <p>If you have ever said any of these things to yourself...something else will make me happy; I’m not a good mom; I will never get past this; I am defined by my weight; I should be further along by now...then you could benefit from the unflinching faith and rock-hard tenacity Rachel Hollis has in store for you. In this challenging but conversational audiobook, Rachel exposes the 20 lies and misconceptions that too often hold us back from living joyfully and productively, lies we’ve told ourselves so often we don’t even hear them anymore.</p> <p>Rachel is real and talks about real issues. More than that, she reveals the specific practical strategies that helped her move past them. In the process, she encourages, entertains, and even kicks a little butt, all to convince you to do whatever it takes to get real and become the joyous, confident woman you were meant to be.
