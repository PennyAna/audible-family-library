window.bookSummaryJSON = "An arrow whistles through the trees as a band of outlaws ride boldly against the Sheriff of Nottingham's men. They seek to overturn injustice, to rob from the rich and give to the poor. They ride, from their hideaway in Sherwood Forest, on to great adventure against tyranny in Old England. They are Little John, Friar Tuck, Will Scarlet, and, of course, the greatest archer of them all, Robin Hood.";
