window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Joseph the Bellmaker is troubled. It has been four seasons since his warrior-mouse daughter, Mariel, and her companion, Dandin, set off from Redwall to fight evil in Mossflower. Nothing has been heard of them since. Then one night, in a dream, the legendary Martin the Warrior comes to the Bellmaker with a mysterious message. Clearly, Mariel and Dandin are in grave danger. Joseph and four Redwallers set off at once to aid them. As they push over land and sea, they cannot know the terrible threats they face: the impossible Foxwolf, Urgan Nagru, his mate Silvamord, and their vicious rat hordes. Can the impetuous sailor-otter Finbarr Galedeep help them cross the sea? What is the mystery of Roaringburn? And most important, will the Bellmaker and his companions arrive in time to help Mariel and Dandin? </p>";
