window.bookSummaryJSON = "Thousands of years, way before Christopher Columbus set sail, wandering tribes of hunters made their way from Asia across the Bering land bridge to North America. They didn't know it, but they had discovered a New World. <i>The First Americans</i> is a fascinating re-creation of pre-Columbian Native American life, and it's an adventure of a lifetime! Hunt seals with the Inuit; harvest corn on a cliff-top mesa; hunt the mighty buffalo; and set sail with Leif Erickson, Columbus, and all the early great explorers, Cabot, Balboa, Ponce de Leon, Cortes, Henry the Navigator, and more, in this brilliantly told story of America before it was America.";
