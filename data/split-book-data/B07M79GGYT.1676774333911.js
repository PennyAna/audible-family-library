window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Jeff Hirsch, the mastermind behind such dark YA dystopias as <i>The Eleventh Plague</i> and <i>The Darkest Hour</i>, goes interstellar with <i>Sovereign</i>, a middle grade Audible Original voiced by Jesse Einstein, who listeners have called first-rate.</p> <p>Micah Cole has been in deep space for four years now. While his parents chase their obsession with finding intelligent life deeper and deeper into the universe, Micah can’t help but dream of the friends he’s left behind and counts the days until the family returns to Earth. When a devastating meteor shower nearly destroys the Coles’s ship, Micah is separated from his family and stranded alone on Sovereign—a vast planet of raging rivers and towering forests. If Micah ever wants to see his family or his home again, he’ll have to learn how to survive on this hostile alien world. Armed with only his wits and determination, he’ll have to battle the elements, his own deepest fears, and a strange presence that might just hold the key to his parents’ obsession—and be his ticket back home.&nbsp;</p>";
