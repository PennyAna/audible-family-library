window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Tom Hiddleston (<i>The Night Manager</i>) stars as Jonathan Harker, with David Suchet (<i>Poirot</i>) as Dracula in Liz Lochhead's powerful BBC radio adaptation of the classic novel by Bram Stoker. </p> <p>When solicitor Jonathan Harker sets off for Transylvania to sell the mysterious Count Dracula a Gothic mansion, his bride-to-be, Mina, begs him to stay - to no avail. But on arrival at Dracula's castle, deep in a black forest surrounded by wolves, Harker wishes he had listened to his fianc√©e. The Count is welcoming but unnerving and his castle oppressive. Plagued by nightmares, Harker soon longs to leave. </p> <p>Back in Whitby, Mina is increasingly worried. She has heard nothing from Jonathan, and now her sister, Lucy - newly engaged to Harker's friend, Dr Seward - is becoming pale and thin. In Seward's lunatic asylum in London, a madman named Renfield babbles about his master, who is coming. And as a midnight storm rages, a black ship heads towards the English coast.... </p> <p>Acclaimed poet and playwright Liz Lochhead's adaptation was first performed onstage in 1985, and this thrilling radio drama was broadcast on the World Service in 2006. Suspenseful, chilling and suffused with dark eroticism, it retains all the eerie dread of Stoker's infamous horror novel. </p> <p>Duration: 2 hours approx. </p>";
