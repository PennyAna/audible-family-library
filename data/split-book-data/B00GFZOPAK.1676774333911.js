window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>An engaging, accessible guide to educating yourself in the classical tradition. </p> <p>Have you lost the art of reading for pleasure? Are there books you know you should read but haven't because they seem too daunting? In <i>The Well-Educated Mind</i>, Susan Wise Bauer provides a welcome and encouraging antidote to the distractions of our age, electronic and otherwise. In her previous book, <i>The Well-Trained Mind</i>, the author provided a road map of classical education for parents wishing to home-school their children, and that book is now the premier resource for home-schoolers. In this new book, Bauer takes the same elements and techniques and adapts them to the use of adult readers who want both enjoyment and self-improvement from the time they spend reading. </p> <p><i>The Well-Educated Mind</i> offers brief, entertaining histories of five literary genres - fiction, autobiography, history, drama, and poetry - accompanied by detailed instructions on how to read each type. The annotated lists at the end of each chapter - ranging from Cervantes to A. S. Byatt, Herodotus to Laurel Thatcher Ulrich - preview recommended reading and encourage readers to make vital connections between ancient traditions and contemporary writing. </p> <p><i>The Well-Educated Mind</i> reassures those readers who worry that they read too slowly or with below-average comprehension. If you can understand a daily newspaper, there's no reason you can't read and enjoy Shakespeare's Sonnets or Jane Eyre. But no one should attempt to read the \"Great Books\" without a guide and a plan. Susan Wise Bauer will show you how to allocate time to your reading on a regular basis; how to master a difficult argument; how to make personal and literary judgments about what you read; how to appreciate the resonant links among texts within a genre - what does Anna Karenina owe to Madame Bovary? - and also between genres. Followed carefully, the advice in <i>The Well-Educated Mind</i> will restore and expand the pleasure of the written word.</p>";
