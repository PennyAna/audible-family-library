window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>A riveting road map to the development of modern scientific thought. </p> <p>Far too often, public discussion of science is carried out by journalists, voters, and politicians who have received their science secondhand. <i>The Story of Western Science</i> shows us the joy and importance of reading groundbreaking science writing for ourselves and guides us back to the masterpieces that have changed the way we think about our world, our cosmos, and ourselves. </p> <p>Able to be referenced individually or listened to together as the narrative of Western scientific development, the book's 28 succinct chapters lead listeners from the first science texts by Hippocrates, Plato, and Aristotle through 20th-century classics in biology, physics, and cosmology. <i>The Story of Western Science</i> illuminates everything from mankind's earliest inquiries to the butterfly effect, from the birth of the scientific method to the rise of earth science and the flowering of modern biology. </p> <p>Each chapter recommends one or more classic books and provides entertaining accounts of crucial contributions to science, vivid sketches of the scientist-writers, and clear explanations of the mechanics underlying each concept. <i>The Story of Western Science</i> reveals science to be a dramatic undertaking practiced by some of history's most memorable characters. It reminds us that scientific inquiry is a human pursuit - an essential, often deeply personal, sometimes flawed, frequently brilliant way of understanding the world. </p> <p>In the tradition of her perennial best seller <i>The Well-Educated Mind</i>, Susan Wise Bauer delivers an accessible, entertaining, and illuminating springboard into the scientific education you never had. </p>";
