window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Seventeen-year-old Smitha has the wealth, status, and beauty that make her the envy of her town - until she rejects a strange man's marriage proposal, and disastrous consequences follow. Smitha becomes cursed, and frost begins to encompass everything she touches. Banished to the hills, hunted by villagers, and chilled to the very core of her soul, she finds companionship with Death, who longs to coax her into his isolated world. But Smitha's desire for life proves stronger than despair, and a newfound purpose gives her renewed hope. Will regrets over the past and an unexpected desire for a man she cannot touch be enough to warm Smitha's heart, or will Death forever still it? </p>";
